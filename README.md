# Autodesk Frontend Test
Created to share my attempt at auto desk front end test.

## Source Structure
```
.
+-- /src
|    +-- /css
|        +-- login.css
|    +-- /js
|        +-- login.js
|    +-- index.html
```

## Limitations 
* key board navigation not fully implemented.
* Server validations are mocked with a array of imaginary users. Following username password pairs can be used to go through the flow.
```
| Username      | Password      |
| ------------- |---------------|
| bob           | bob           |
| sam           | sam           |
| john          | john          |
```

## Assumptions
* Content centered vertically.
